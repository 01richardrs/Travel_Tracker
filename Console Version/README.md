# CP1404 2019 SP1 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: Richard Setiawan

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  
**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> Around 2-3 days , with each day around 1-4 hours and some are more than 4 hours
> and around 1week to check code and try simplify the code with each day around 1-2 hours

2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> My plan to do in development process for assignment 2 is first i need to plan
the logic or the plan of how the program works and then code with making functions to shorten the code
and each time i make function i make sure give comments because in this first assignment 
i spend 1 week to recheck my code and try simplify the code with the logic that i just get
after i finished the works.
