_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get full marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
    The entire project took me around 15 days With around 1 - 2 hours per day. 

Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
    I am satisfied with things that i learn from this assignment on how i assign class 
    and connect it with other child class and make simple applications that show output and process the data in object form.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
    What i least satisfied with this assignments is the constructions given is need more improvement on the details, 
    the documents only show limited informations and i expect to make the applications with more popular class applications , because Kivy is not quite popular and make searching the information much harder.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
    What worked well in my development process is to change my assignment 1 functions to method and 
    it took only few times to change some minor things.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
    I would like to improve on my planning for how i make the applications and the requirements needed.
    In this assignments i am quite struggling to make the applications into 3 classes, what i make before is 2 classes based on
    the instructions given in the documents and make place class to my main class.
## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
    Most of my development process come from internet, I used them to search my errors and read through some method and functions requirements for kivy.
    I also search some resources in lecture slides and practicals that is provided to guide me through the basic or feature of applications like spinners.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
    The main challange of this assignment is how to changed terminal or text display into real applications
    and how to used kivy well and also how to convert to 3 main class files.
    
    I overcome this problem by change function that i make in assignment 1 to method
    and i make the kivy template with make some print functions to see the method is works.
    I also try learn kivy from lecture slides ,practicals, and internet by looking through the practicals and try each method.
    to convert from 2 class to 3 class i overcome that by try seperate the method and changed to other classes.
